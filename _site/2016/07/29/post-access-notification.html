<p>Some services require a forced update to someone’s data, followed by a notification that it has occurred so that they have an opportunity to appeal. An example of this is if points for speeding need to be added to someone’s driving licence.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Driving licence points</li>
  <li>Land Registry property alerts</li>
</ul>
