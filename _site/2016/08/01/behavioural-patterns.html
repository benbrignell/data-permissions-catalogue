<p>Access is allowed if a someones activity matches past behaviour. For example, a card transaction might be declined if used somewhere the user doesn’t usually go to.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Online bank transfer declined sent to an account they’ve not sent to before</li>
  <li>Facebook blocks a login attempt if it comes from an IP the person doesn’t usually visit from</li>
  <li>LastPass declines access to the service when it’s accessed from abroad. A link is sent to the account holder by email to confirm the attempt was legitimate</li>
</ul>
